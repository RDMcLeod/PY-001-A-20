# PY-001-A-20
This is an initial setup for the coding file structure and I will see how it goes
File Structure is a PY=python/ 001 = file number /-A is revision for for project/-20 is the year / P1 = Project 1 or original project / when the file number changes that would constitue the creation a origin repo -002 a revision change to -B and P1 would become P2.
